## Description of the Task

The TEXT-SUMMARIZATION-TOOL project is designed to address the growing need for efficient and accurate condensation of lengthy textual content into concise, coherent summaries. In today’s information-rich environment, readers are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of articles, reports, and documents available online. Manually scanning through large bodies of text to extract key insights is time-consuming and prone to human error. The primary objective of this internship task is to develop a reusable, command-line Python application that employs state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically generate summaries of arbitrary input text.

Over the course of this four-week internship, the project will be divided into several stages. Initially, an in-depth literature review and technology survey will be conducted to evaluate existing summarization approaches, both extractive and abstractive. Extractive methods identify and select salient sentences directly from the original text, whereas abstractive methods—driven by deep learning—have the capacity to paraphrase and reorganize content, producing more natural and human-like summaries. Considering the trade-offs in complexity, resource requirements, and output quality, the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model from Facebook AI Research has been chosen for its robust performance on abstractive summarization benchmarks.

The second phase will focus on setting up the development environment. Leveraging the `transformers` library by Hugging Face along with PyTorch as the deep learning backend, we will create a lightweight Python script—`summarizer.py`—that instantiates a summarization pipeline. To ensure modularity and extensibility, the code is organized into functions for model loading, text preprocessing, summarization, and result formatting. Comprehensive inline comments and docstrings accompany each function, facilitating code readability and future maintenance.

In the third stage, rigorous testing will be performed using diverse document samples, including news articles, blog posts, academic abstracts, and longer reports. Real-world text is often noisy and may contain HTML tags or unconventional formatting. Robust preprocessing routines will be implemented to sanitize the input by removing markup, handling Unicode characters, and splitting large documents into manageable chunks. The summarizer’s performance will be evaluated based on metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores, with manual qualitative assessments to ensure the summaries preserve the original text’s meaning without introducing factual inaccuracies.

Beyond core functionality, the project also emphasizes user experience. The command-line interface accepts customizable parameters for maximum and minimum summary lengths, allowing end users to tailor summaries according to their specific needs. Error handling mechanisms have been integrated to gracefully notify users of missing input files or invalid arguments. A detailed README (this document) guides users through installation, setup, and execution steps, ensuring rapid adoption by developers and content creators.

Finally, the project’s deliverables will be version-controlled and hosted on GitHub, providing full transparency and collaborative potential. The repository will contain the main script, sample articles, a `requirements.txt` file listing dependencies, and illustrative examples of summary output. Future enhancements may include a web-based interface, support for batch processing of multiple files, and integration with cloud-based NLP APIs for scalability. Contributions from the open-source community will be encouraged through clear contribution guidelines and issue templates.

In summary, this TEXT-SUMMARIZATION-TOOL not only demonstrates the practical application of advanced NLP models but also delivers a production-ready utility that streamlines the summarization workflow. By automating the extraction of essential information from large texts, the tool enhances productivity, reduces cognitive load, and empowers users to focus on critical insights rather than manual reading. Through continuous iteration and community feedback, the project aims to evolve into a versatile platform for text summarization across multiple domains.

## Program Run Procedure

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
